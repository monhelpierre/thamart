This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Learn More

To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API.
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial.

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.

Check out our [Next.js deployment documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/deploying) for more details.

## Environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill the Firebase values before running locally. The app requires both client-side Firebase keys (NEXT_PUBLIC_*) and a server-side `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` JSON string for admin APIs.

Example:

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
# edit .env.local and paste your Firebase config
```

Notes:
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT` must be a valid service account JSON encoded as a single line (newlines in the private key escaped as `\n`).
- If you don't set `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT`, some server routes (seed, users, carts) will return an error.

## Local Setup

Install dependencies and run the dev server:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Seed the database (if needed) by visiting `/api/seed` while the server is running — the API will populate Firestore with initial products if empty.

If you want me to add deployment instructions for Vercel / Docker, say so and I will expand this section.
